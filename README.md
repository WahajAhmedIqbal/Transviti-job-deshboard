# Job Dashboard - React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

This project is a job dashboard built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user interface for finding and managing job applications.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling custom designs.

## Features

*   **Job Listings:** Displays a list of available job openings. (Currently a placeholder - needs data integration)
*   **Search and Filtering:** Allows users to search for jobs based on keywords, location, and other criteria. (Not yet implemented)
*   **Job Details:** Provides detailed information about each job, including description, requirements, and company information. (Not yet implemented)
*   **Application Tracking:** Enables users to track the status of their job applications. (Not yet implemented)
*   **User Authentication:** (Planned) Secure user accounts for saving job preferences and application history.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WahajAhmedIqbal/Transviti-job-deshboard
    cd Transviti-job-deshboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite assigns).

Live Demo

## Configuration

*   **`vite.config.js`:**  This file contains the Vite configuration, including server settings, build options, and plugins.  You can customize this file to adjust the build process.

*   **`tailwind.config.js`:** This file configures Tailwind CSS, allowing you to customize the theme, colors, fonts, and other styling options.  Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for details.

*   **`postcss.config.js`:** This file configures PostCSS, which is used by Tailwind CSS.  You typically don't need to modify this file unless you're adding custom PostCSS plugins.

## Scripts

The `package.json` file includes the following scripts:

*   `dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
*   `build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `preview`:  Locally previews the production build.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, build it using `npm run build` (or `yarn build` or `pnpm build`). This will create a `dist` directory containing the production-ready files. You can then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to a web server or hosting platform like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3.
